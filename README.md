# NFLGameReview
This project is the practical part of my bachelor's thesis.
It allows you to create football game reviews that from structured data by utilizing the Transformer Model for text generation.
The model is trained on the game reviews found on www.walterfootball.com and the data is gathered from www.espn.com. Both sites are scraped with pythons BeautifulSoup4,
which is used to collect the data. This data is then formatted, aligned and fed to the Transformer Model to produce texts solely from the structured data.
